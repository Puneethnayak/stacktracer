<p>Tool to capture stack traces for a dot net process.</p>

Introducing Stacktracer.exe
-------------------------------
<p>We would like you to introduce to a new debugging tool called Stacktracer.exe which we have been developing for sometime. This tool is in its initial state and we would like to add a some more useful  functionality. We are looking for feedback on bugs, usability and features from you. </p>

<p>Currently we don’t have a tool to troubleshoot hangs less than 15 seconds and this tool we can easily find the root cause right in customer machine without any extra download of symbols or long analysis  etc.</p>	


##Highlights

>*	800 kb single exe file with only dependency of .net framework 4.5 client profile
>*	Captures stack trace of any .net process Windows forms ,WPF, asp.net you name it 
>*	No need of any symbols
>*	Supports .net framework 2.0 to 4.5
>*	Can target 32bit and 64 bit process
>*	View traces in your favourite browser IE  (inspired from IIS FREB)
>*	Intuitive timeline view to filter out unwanted stacks/threads
>*	Very easy to troubleshoot Hang or High CPU issues on customer machines
>*	Can troubleshoot hangs less than 5 seconds easily.	


##Limitations

>*	Needs .NET framework 4.5 client profile(we are working on this to support 4.0)
>*	Will not show any native stack information
>*	That means if the hang is due to GC, this may not help you
